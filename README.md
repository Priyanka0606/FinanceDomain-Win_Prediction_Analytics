# WIN Prediction Analytics

In this project, we will analyze and predict the win possibilities of deals/projects for an IT consulting company and see how the possibility of winning a
deal is impacted by other variables. This will enable the IT consulting company to manage the effort required to win a deal to meet the growth
targets.

This project identifies the best bid manager-SBU Head combination who can convert an opportunity to win with the provided data points. The objectives are: Objective 1: Predictive
Analytics - Build a ML model to predict the probability of win/loss for bidding activities for a potential client. Objective 2: Prescriptive Analytics â€“ Identify variable/s
that are most likely to help in converting an opportunity into a win.

Descriptive Analytics is used to describe data ,derive insights using descriptive statistics, data visualization and queries.

Supervised learning algorithms try to model relationships and dependencies between the target prediction output and the input features such that we can predict the output values for new data based on those relationships which it learned from the previous data sets. This project uses different Supervised ML Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Bagging Model, Boosting Models, KNN and SVM Models to find the best performing models.
